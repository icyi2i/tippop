# TipPop

A minimal react tooltip component!

## Setup for development

1. Clone the repository

   `git clone https://github.com/icyi2i/tippop.git`

2. Install npm dependencies from the outer package.json

   `npm install`

3. Make changes in the components. Add/Install new dependencies in the package.
   json in components directory.

4. (Optional) Document your changes in changelog. Would help everyone understand
   it.

5. Raise a merge/pull request. :)

## Versioning and editing changelog

Versioning syntax follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Newer
versions should be mapped to v[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH] syntax for consistency.

Versions need not be increased in case of non-functional changes. But it's
welcome to be added to the changelog for ease of tracking.

Changelog should be appropriately updated. Follow the syntax for new versions.

```markdown
<!-- Newer versions should have a heading for the same to group changes -->

### [vM.m.P]

<!-- New changes need to documented -->

- [Change] - A description that makes sense based on changes
```

For ease of operations, add git commit messages, and change it later. :)
